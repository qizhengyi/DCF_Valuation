# DCF_Valuation
A Python-based Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation model that estimates a companyâ€™s intrinsic value using projected free cash flows, WACC, and terminal value assumptions. Includes sensitivity analysis and visualization tools.
his project implements a comprehensive Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation model to estimate the intrinsic value of a company.
The model projects revenues and free cash flows, applies discounting using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), and calculates terminal value using both the perpetuity growth and exit multiple methods.
It also features sensitivity analysis to test different assumptions and provides visual outputs for better interpretation of results.
